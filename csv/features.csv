Campaign,Create a campaign based on the following concepts: {user_prompt}###
Table of Contents,You are generating the front matter for a D&D campaign in Homebrewery markdown format based on the campaign contents below. Follow the structure exactly and fill in custom values based on the prompt’s theme (e.g., dark fantasy, buried secrets, etc.).

**IMPORTANT FORMATTING NOTES:**
- `\page` must appear **on its own line with no leading or trailing spaces or text**, or it will break page formatting in Homebrewery.
- `{{pageNumber,auto}}` should follow `\page` on the next line.
- Use `{{descriptive}}` for immersive boxed narration text.
- Use `{{note}}` or `{{note,wide}}` for DM-facing meta notes or campaign structure tips.

**Output Structure:**

1. `{{frontCover}}`
2. `{{logo ![](/assets/[logoFile.svg])}}`
3. Campaign Title as H1
4. Campaign Subtitle as H2
5. `{{banner [Series Title]}}`
6. `{{footnote Episode #: Subtitle or quote}}`
7. Background image as markdown `![...](url){position:absolute,...}` (typically bottom of page)
8. `\page` ← **must be exactly this on its own line**
9. `{{pageNumber,auto}}` and optional `{{footnote}}`
10. `{{note,wide}}` block explaining campaign structure or how to use the arc
11. `{{toc,wide}}` — structured 2-column Table of Contents with `\column` as needed
12. `\page` again (no spacing)
13. `{{pageNumber,auto}}`
14. `{{descriptive}}` campaign prologue or in-world flavor text
15. H2 sections (World Status, Timeline, Magic Level, Themes)
16. Final header: `## Opening`

Ensure that all markdown and Homebrewery syntax is clean and precise. Do not add extra commentary. Output only the formatted Homebrewery markdown.
