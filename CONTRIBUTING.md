# Contributing to CampaignCreator

We appreciate your interest in contributing to CampaignCreator! Whether it's reporting a bug, suggesting a feature, or offering code improvements, your help is welcome.

## Reporting Bugs

If you encounter a bug, please help us by reporting it:

1.  **Check Existing Issues:** Before creating a new issue, please check if the bug has already been reported.
2.  **Open a New Issue:** If the bug hasn't been reported, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.
    *   Provide a clear and descriptive title.
    *   Describe the bug in detail, including the steps to reproduce it.
    *   Explain what you expected to happen and what actually happened.
    *   Include information about your environment (e.g., iOS version, device model, app version if applicable).

## Feature Suggestions

We are always looking for ways to improve CampaignCreator:

1.  **Check Existing Suggestions:** See if your idea has already been suggested or discussed.
2.  **Open a New Issue:** If not, please open an issue on GitHub to suggest new features or enhancements.
    *   Use a clear and descriptive title.
    *   Explain the feature and why you think it would be beneficial.
    *   Provide as much detail as possible about how you envision the feature working.

## Pull Requests

We welcome contributions in the form of Pull Requests. If you're planning to contribute code, please consider the following:

*   **Discuss First:** For significant changes (e.g., new features, major refactoring), it's often best to open an issue first to discuss your ideas and ensure they align with the project's goals. This can save effort and ensure your contribution is likely to be merged.
*   **Coding Style:** Please try to adhere to the existing coding style and conventions relevant to the part of the project you are contributing to (e.g., Python/FastAPI for the `campaign_crafter_api`, TypeScript/React for the `campaign_crafter_ui`, or Swift for the iOS app). Consistent code style helps maintain readability and makes collaboration easier.
*   **Testing:**
    *   Include tests for new features or bug fixes where applicable.
    *   Ensure existing tests pass with your changes.
    *   (More detailed testing guidelines may be provided in the respective component READMEs, e.g., `campaign_crafter_api/README.md` or `campaign_crafter_ui/README.md`).
*   **Commit Messages:** Write clear, concise, and descriptive commit messages. A good commit message explains the "what" and "why" of the change.
*   **Documentation:** Update any relevant documentation (e.g., README files, code comments) if your changes impact it.
*   **Branching:** Create your changes in a feature branch from the `main` or `develop` branch (or as specified by project maintainers).
*   **Keep it Focused:** Try to keep pull requests focused on a single issue or feature. Smaller, well-defined PRs are easier to review and merge.

*(As the project grows, more detailed guidelines for development setup and coding standards for each component may be found in their respective directories.)*

Thank you for helping make CampaignCreator better!
