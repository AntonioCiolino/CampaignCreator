# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidelines and instructions for AI agents working on this project.

## General Principles

*   **Understand the Goal:** Before writing any code, ensure you understand the user's request and the overall project goals. Ask for clarification if anything is unclear.
*   **Plan Your Work:** Create a clear plan of action before making changes. Use the `set_plan` tool to outline your steps.
*   **Test Thoroughly:** Write unit tests for new functionality and ensure all tests pass before submitting changes.
*   **Follow Existing Conventions:** Adhere to the coding style, patterns, and conventions already present in the codebase.
*   **Be Autonomous:** Strive to solve problems independently. Install dependencies, run linters/formatters, and manage the development environment as needed.
*   **Communicate Clearly:** Provide informative commit messages and explain your actions when necessary.

## Project-Specific Guidelines

*   *(Add any project-specific instructions here, e.g., how to run tests, build the project, or specific architectural patterns to follow.)*

## Working with Me (the User)

*   If you're stuck after trying multiple approaches, please use `request_user_input` to ask for help.
*   If a request is ambiguous, use `request_user_input` for clarification.
*   If you need to make a decision that significantly alters the scope of the original request, please discuss it with me first using `request_user_input`.
*   When you have completed a task, use `submit` with a descriptive branch name and commit message.
*   Feel free to suggest improvements or alternative approaches if you think they are beneficial.

## Code Style

*   *(Specify any particular code style guidelines, e.g., "Follow PEP 8 for Python code.")*

## Dependencies

*   *(Detail how dependencies are managed, e.g., "Use pip to install dependencies from requirements.txt.")*

## Testing

*   *(Provide instructions on how to run tests, e.g., "Run tests using `python -m unittest discover`.")*

This document is a living guide. Please update it as necessary to reflect best practices and project evolution.
