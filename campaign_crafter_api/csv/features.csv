{{{{toc,wide
# Table Of Contents
- ### [{{Section Title from input}}{{PAGENUM}}](#pPAGENUM)
  - #### [{{Possible Subsection Title - LLM can infer or be omitted if not applicable}}{{PAGENUM}}](#pPAGENUM)
{{!-- LLM can add more subsections or main sections as appropriate based on the input sections_summary. Ensure all page numbers use PAGENUM placeholders. --}}

TOC Display,"Based on the campaign concept provided below, generate a user-friendly Table of Contents for on-screen display.
For each suggested section title, also determine its most appropriate type from the following list:
[monster, character, npc, location, item, quest, chapter, note, world_detail, generic].

Output each top-level section as a bullet point starting with '- '.
The format for each line should be: `- {{Generated Section Title}} [Type: {{SuggestedType}}]`
For example:
- The Whispering Caves [Type: location]
- Rescuing the Artifact [Type: quest]
  - The Guardian Golem [Type: monster]
  - The Hidden Lever [Type: item]
- Elara, the Wise Sage [Type: npc]

Focus on clear section titles. Subsections can be nested with indentation if appropriate, following the same format.
