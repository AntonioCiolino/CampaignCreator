# This file makes the 'services' directory a Python package.

# You can optionally expose parts of your modules at the package level, for example:
# from .auth_service import authenticate_user
# from .image_generation_service import generate_image

# For now, keeping it simple. Users of this package can import directly from the modules:
# e.g., from campaign_crafter_api.app.services.auth_service import authenticate_user
